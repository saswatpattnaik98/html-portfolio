<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an entrepreneur who is solving loneliness for the World. <br>
Something just by chance or by ChansðŸ˜Œ</p>

<p>Even as an extrovert, I found it extremely difficult to socialize recently. I wanted to interact with the people I see in my nearby places, but it seemed like no one was interested in having a 2 min conversation as they all started scrolling through their phones the moment we had an eye-contact for more than a second. 
  I donâ€™t want to see our world like this. We all feel lonely most of the time and want to meet people, yet somehow we have this non-welcoming aura toward others.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, I have been trying to solve loneliness by working on projects like 9:30 Club, Marker, 1-Date, and Find My Cult. But now, I have gathered insights that will allow us to address the core problem while building a great business.</p>
